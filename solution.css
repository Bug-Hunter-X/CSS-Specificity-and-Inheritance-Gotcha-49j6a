The solution involves understanding CSS specificity and avoiding overuse of `!important`. Here's a revised version of the CSS:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.child .grandchild {
  color: green !important; /* Now, this will override the parent's color */
}
```

By removing the unnecessary `!important` in `.child` and adding it to `.child .grandchild`, we ensure that the intended `color: green` takes precedence.  This approach is more maintainable and easier to understand.
